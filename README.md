Inspired by a blog post [Air Quality Monitors: When Paying More Does Not Get You More Accuracy](https://www.airgradient.com/blog/expensive-air-quality-monitors-not-more-accurate/) by Achim Haug, this repository will compare various air quality monitors using data from [South Coast Air Quality Management District (SC-AQMD)](https://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/criteria-pollutants/summary-pm).

# TODO

- [ ] Download data from [SC-AQMD](https://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/criteria-pollutants/summary-pm)
